# waitForApt.sh

# Script that will wait for process locking /var/lib/dpkg/lock to finish
# - must be run as root
# - will wait for 120s for lock to get freed
# - if lock is not freed in time, will kill any apt instances running on background
#   and will clean up after them 
# inspired by script from stackoverflow user Radu RÄƒdeanu
